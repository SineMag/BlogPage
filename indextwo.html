                        <h3>Comparing Windows, Mac and Linux Operating Systems</h3>
                </div>

                <div class="content-w">
                       <h3>Windows <i class="fa fa-window"></i></h3> 
                       <h4>Files and Directories, Naming Conventions, and the File Allocation Table (FAT)</h4>
                       <p>This system uses a backslash to clarify file-paths.<br> For example, C:\User\Folder1\SubFolder\example.exe.</p>
                       <p>Windows naming conversion is not case-sensitive. So a file names WINDOWS=Windows</p>
                       <p>There has to be a maximum of 260 characters, containing special characters question mark ?, backslash\, forward-slash /, asterisk *, colon :, quotation mark “, less/greater than < >, and vertical bar |.</p>
                       <p>Windows 10 and 11 support the File Allocation Table filing system. However, they use the New Technology Filing System (NTFS) by default, and Resilient File System (Reefs) to a much lesser extent.</p>
                       <p>In Windows, FAT is mostly used by the older versions of the system. Hence from 10 to the current version (i.e., Windows 11), the NTFS is used even though both versions still support the FAT system.</p>

                       <h4>Executable File Extensions</h4>
                       <p>.bt (batch),<br> .exe(executable),<br> .msi(Windows installer package),<br> .cmd(command prompt), <br>.wsf(Windows script files), <br>.com(Microsoft-DOS).</p>
                       <p>C:\Windows\system32\>cmd.exe and enter to run commands.</p>
                       <p>Windows has shell access, running both on the PoweShell and Terminal</p>

                </div>

                <div class="content-m">
                        <h3>Mac</h3>
                        <h4>Files and Directories, Naming Conventions, and the File Allocation Table (FAT)</h4>
                        <p>As opposed to Windows backslash, MacOS uses forward-slashes(/) to show a directory.</p>
                        <p>For a MacOS, Foldername is not the same as FolderName. Therefore, it is essential to note the cases </p>
                        <p>MacOS doesn't allow a colon (:) but does for most special characters.</p>
                        <p>MacOS’s file system uses File Allocation Table (FAT) structure like Windows. However, its default system is an Apple Filing System (APFS) from the MacOS version 10.13 to the latest/current version.</p>
                        <p>FAT32 is currently being used by the MacOS, it is from the evolution of the FATs original system. </p>

                        <h4>Executable File Extensions</h4>
                        <p>.app(application bundle),<br> .command(shell scripts),<br> .dylib(dynamic library),<br> .dmg(disk image)</p>
                        <p>As mentioned in the directory structure that MacOS uses forward-slashes, so its script file is /. For example, /User/Folder1/Subfolder/example.app</p>
                        <p>Mac's Operating System has shell access using the Terminal <strong>only</strong></p>

                        <h3>Linux</h3>
                        <h4>Files and Directories, Naming Conventions, and the File Allocation Table (FAT)</h4>
                        <p>Almost similar to the MacOS, Linux uses forward slashes(/) for the root directory.</p>
                        <p>Linux is also case-sensive, so this OS also doesn't allow File and FILE to be equal/same.</p>
                        <p>There are restricted characters like the forward-slash (/), and the null character, otherwise they allow most characters.</p>
                        <p>Linux supports FAT32, and NTFS too.</p>
                        <p> Mostly for compatibility and removable disks, in order to work well with other systems.</p>

                        <h4>Executable File Extensions</h4>
                        <p> Regular files,<br> directories,<br> and special files.</p>
                        <p> Linux can execute from a command line with ./ prefix.</p>
                        <p> Terminal, and shell access.</p>
