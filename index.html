                        <h2>Cyber Security</h2>
                        <p>With the increasing number of cyber threats, IT professionals must constantly update their
                                skills and knowledge to protect systems and data. This can be a significant challenge,
                                especially in regions with limited resources.</p><br>

                        <p>There is often a shortage of skilled IT professionals in Africa, which can make it difficult
                                for companies to find qualified candidates. This can lead to increased workloads for
                                existing staff and can hinder the growth of the IT sector.</p><br>

                        <p>Many African countries are undergoing digital transformation, which can create challenges for
                                IT professionals as they adapt to new technologies and processes. This can require
                                significant training and development efforts.</p><br>
                        <img src="./media/cloudComp.jpg" style="width: 20%;">
                        <h2>Cloud Computing</h2>
                        <p>Because more companies move to the cloud for storage, IT professionals need to learn new
                                skills and adapt to different ways of working. This can be a challenge, especially for
                                those who are used to traditional on-premises systems.</p><br>
                        <img src="./media/careergro.jpg" style="width: 20%;">

                                or projects. This can be due to a lack of understanding of the IT sector or a focus on
                                short-term goals rather than long-term strategic planning.</p><br>
